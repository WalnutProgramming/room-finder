For detail about each release, see our GitHub Releases page: <https://github.com/WalnutProgramming/room-finder/releases>.

We will follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). However, since we are still in the 0.0.z stage of versioning, there may be breaking changes in any release (https://semver.org/#spec-item-4). Once we reach version 0.y.z, we will follow the convention that breaking changes will not occur when only z changes.
